When we have a common prorotype for some object we always want them to have this property.
We use prototype pattern

ALex and Sue and two shopper going for camping they have to buys what is called required items so that must be present on both.
Rest items can be specified and bought according to your needs.
These items are different for each but both of them have a base same prototype.

//version 1
we create two objects but initalise it deifferently and thus repeating ourselves.
//version 2
we craeted a file that creates instance for us and assign it required property.
